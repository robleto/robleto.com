Hello there 👋, thanks for visiting.

This site has been a long time coming and represents my evolution from a simple, single-page profile to a more dynamic, app-style site. The goal is to keep it fresh and active, allowing me to continually update and expand it over time. What started as a basic landing page has now grown into a platform that reflects both my work and personal journey, blending functionality with a design that I can continuously improve.
