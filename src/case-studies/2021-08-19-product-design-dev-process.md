---


**The Challenge**  
Executive leadership wanted The Motley Fool to emulate Apple's approach to product development.

**The Solution**  
Leveraging the consultation of a former Apple engineer, defining, adapting and personally piloting an approach that overhauled the Fool's product development process

**Results**
The DRI model I helped codify for use at The Motley Fool and utilized on it's test run (while leading the developing a new product) became the de facto approach for product development at the company, replicated across all departments and projects.

### The DRI approach focused on rapid prototyping and demos to the executive leadership making the design team became a critical piece of this new product development process
